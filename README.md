# Predicting At Risk Students Using Machine Learning Techniques
# Agile Methodology
PROJECT OVERVIEW
The major goal of the project is to identify students who are at risk for not graduating on time. Based on a variety of longitudinal, student level data, a predictive model to identify students who are at risk of not graduating high school on time and may benifit from targeted interventions. It ensures that students are on track for success.

PROBLEM DEFINITION
The main problem is on-time graduation and college undermatching, i.e. applying to post-secondary institutions below their capability or not applying at all. A student did graduate on time when:
i) The student dropped out of school sometime after enrollment, or
ii) The student was retained
to ensure that all students are on track for success, "early warning" model can be built to identify students who may need extra attension.

GOALS OF THE PROJECT
the main goals of the project is to both:

i) generate accurate predictions and

ii) present the predictions through an actionable interface.

The design and implementation of a web based tool that can be used by school administrators and counselors to track the risk scores of their students over time, allowing them to easily identify students that are in need of personal attention.

The data for the project is being collected from the school records provided by MCPS in Rockville, Maryland US; or can be dowloaded from the following link:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance , which includes features that can be grouped into three categories: academic(quarterly GPA, standardized test scores),behavioural(percentage of time absent, number of suspensions, etc.),and enrollment-related(e.g.mobility,new to school district etc).

THE SCOPE OF THE WORK
The data from previous high school cohorts were obtained and modelled their outcomes. then this predictive model is applied to predict the risk of falling behind.
The second step is to generate an urgency score associated with each of the students.
